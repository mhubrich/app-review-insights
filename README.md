# App Review Insights

![Application example](/example/demo.gif)

## Usage

This dashboard highlights keywords that are common in both positive and negative app reviews. Knowledge about these keywords helps to improve an app. For example, one could double-down on identified positive trends or use the negative keywords to fix potential bugs.

The dashboard comes with a number of filters in a side panel, for example by rating, country, OS or date range.

This package comes with functionality to download app reviews from [Appfigures](https://appfigures.com) via their API. However, app reviews can be imported from other sources, too.

## Installation

To get a local copy, simply clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/mhubrich/app-review-insights.git`.

The application uses a couple of Python packages which can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
